### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Hugo and I'm a recent Computer Science grad with a passion for software engineering but am also venturing into the cyber security side of things this year. I am most proficient in C#, Python, & PHP. I'm also working on a next.js typescript project at the moment to gain skills with this framework and language.

### I'm currently working on:
- An all in one smart home controller with TypeScript and Next.js framework
- An app to learn Russian using TypeScript and Next.js
